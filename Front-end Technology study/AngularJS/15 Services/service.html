Why we need Service?
Services are JavaScript functions, which are responsible to perform only specific tasks. 
This makes them individual entities which are maintainable and testable. 
The controllers and filters can call them on requirement basis. 
Services are normally injected using the dependency injection mechanism of AngularJS

AngularJS provides many inbuilt services. 

For example, $http, $route, $window, $location, etc. 
Each service is responsible for a specific task 
such as the $http is used to make ajax call to get the server data, 
the $route is used to define the routing information, and so on. 

The inbuilt services are always prefixed with $ symbol

two ways to create a service:
Factory
Service

    <h2>AngularJS Sample Application</h2>

    <div ng-app="mainApp" ng-controller="CalcController">
        <p>Enter a number: <input type="number" ng-model="number" /></p>
        <button ng-click="square()">X<sup>2</sup></button>
        <p>Result: {{result}}</p>
    </div>

    <script>
        var mainApp = angular.module("mainApp", []);

        // Using Factory Method
        mainApp.factory('MathService', function () {
            var factory = {};

            factory.multiply = function (a, b) {
                return a * b
            }
            return factory;
        });

        //Using Service Method, inject an already available service to it
        mainApp.service('CalcService', function (MathService) {
            this.square = function (a) {
                return MathService.multiply(a, a);
            }
        });
        
        mainApp.controller('CalcController', function ($scope, CalcService) {
            $scope.square = function () {
                $scope.result = CalcService.square($scope.number);
            }
        });
