Custom directives are used in AngularJS to extend the functionality of HTML. 
Custom directives are defined using "directive" function. 
A custom directive simply replaces the element for which it is activated.

AngularJS application during bootstrap finds the matching elements 
and do one time activity using its compile() method of the custom directive 
then process the element using link() method of the custom directive based on the scope of the directive.

AngularJS provides support to create custom directives for following type of elements:
   Element directives − Directive activates when a matching element is encountered.
   Attribute − Directive activates when a matching attribute is encountered.
   CSS − Directive activates when a matching css style is encountered.
   Comment − Directive activates when a matching comment is encountered.

    <h2>AngularJS Sample Application</h2>

    <div ng-app="mainApp" ng-controller="StudentController">

        /* Create a directive, first parameter is the html element to be attached. 
        We are attaching student html tag. 
        This directive will be activated as soon as any student element is encountered in html */
        mainApp.directive('student', function () {
            //define the directive object
            var directive = {};

            directive.restrict = 'E';

            //template replaces the complete element with its text. 
            directive.template = "Student: <b>{{student.name}}</b> , Roll No: <b>{{student.rollno}}</b>";

            //scope is used to distinguish each student element based on criteria.
            directive.scope = {
                student: "=name"
            }

                element.css("border", "1px solid #cccccc");

                //linkFunction is linked with each element with scope to get the element specific data.

                    element.html("Student: <b>" + $scope.student.name + "</b> , Roll No: <b>" + $scope.student
